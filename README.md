# Mapping_Chlorophyll
Project to map chlorophyll concentrations for the Laboratory for Cross-Disciplinary Study of Marine Systems (CROSSMAR) at The University of Haifa

## Overarching goal:
To link the properties of the phytoplankton community (as described in the table), to spatial patterns (as emerge from the satellite data)

## At this stage:
1. Project the locations of a few measurements from the SeaFlow data onto the map (netcdf image)
2. See what is the relationship between abundance of one phytoplankton at a given location, and chlorophyll value at the pixel overlapping it (can choose any day from the table, not necessarily the same as the image)

## datasets: 
- MODIS-Aqua satellite chlorophyll image (in netcdf format)
- SeaFlow data: table with many phytoplankton measurements from the Northeast Pacific. The plankton data is described in the paper by Ribalet etal. 2019 and is downloaded from this website:Â  https://zenodo.org/record/3994953.
